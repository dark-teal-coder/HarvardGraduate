    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Get your Harvard ID and download and install Anaconda before the first class. (See Modules/Resources/Tips on the course site for details on these important steps). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Anaconda and install it. See Modules/Resources/Tips for details on installing Anaconda on Mac and Windows machines. If you are running Linux, we assume you know what you are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Jupyter Notebook from Modules/Day 1 and open it. See the Tips page for details on running Jupyter Notebooks. Run some of the cells and see what they do. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the Command Line Interface before the first class. Please run through Zed Shaw's <a href=\"https://www.computervillage.org/articles/CommandLine.pdf\">Command Line Crash Course</a> exercises, which you can find online or in his <a href=\"https://learncodethehardway.org/python/\">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> books. It is long so don't try to learn it all in one sitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tell Us about You\n",
    "\n",
    "From Canvas, click the [Account] button in the CANVAS navigation menu on the left. Go to Account/Profile, and tell us a bit about yourself. If there is no picture, or if you don't like your picture, upload a nice one. The main purpose is to help people recognize you, so don't use a photo of your dog or your lunch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the other features under Account.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course we will make your profiles viewable by others in the class, so don't put any personal information that you wouldn't want to be public.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Watching Lectures \n",
    "\n",
    "I post the lectures and notebooks with the lectures: feel free to download them and follow along. Play with the notebook, trying different things.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Think Python, by Allen B. Downey, 2nd edition, O'Reilly, Sebastopol, California. The 2nd edition talks about Python 3: the 1st edition talks about Python 2. We will be using Python 3, so be sure to get the 2nd edition. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent book. If you plan to learn Python, it is worth having, even if you decide that this class is not for you.  I prefer a paper copy, but you may prefer an electronic copy. You can find a PDF at http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to read the book?\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it best to read each chapter two times: once before lecture, and to read it again after viewing lecture. The book is short, and each chapter will make more sense the 2nd time you read it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it useful to keep a list of things you don't understand, and try to work through that list. You can use markers, highlighters, a to-do list, or write on the back of your hand. Reviewing a list, and updating your understanding of each point, is a good way for you to take charge of your learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can reach us through Canvas or through e-mail, we would prefer that you route all questions through the ED discussion board. Other students may have the same question, or may have an answer. To make sure you can find it, go to ED discussion board now (look in the left column) and post a reply to my Welcome post. "

    "<blockquote><i>\"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\" - Hal Abelson</i></blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a reason it is called 'code' - it is often hard for us to understand something we wrote last week. \n",
    "\n",
    "I often see a program that works perfectly, but has no comments. I will ask the staff to mark down if you don't properly comment your programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples** \n",
    "\n",
    "The examples provided in lecture are meant to be discussed while being presented, and I often remove the comments to fit a whole thought onto a page in 36 point type. I hope that you will look at the full programs that we post, which have a different feel.  \n",
    "**Rules** \n",
    "\n",
    "Commenting, like many behaviors we like to encourage, is difficult to describe. At the risk of being pedantic, I will set some common-sense requirements. I acknowledge that I don't always follow all of these: I will strive to present a better example, but I am trying to help you find a happy medium rather than pretending to be perfect. \n",
    "\n",
    "These rules apply to stand-alone scripts and to notebooks, with modification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While these came off the top of my head, they are pretty commonly accepted. See, for example: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/commenting.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Header** \n",
    "\n",
    "The start of stand alone program should include the following: \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# programName.py\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Purpose of program\n",
    "# Usage:\n",
    "#      % python programName.py parameters\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Author and Date\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not needed for a Juypter Notebook with multiple fragments. Notebooks should include the author and date at the head of the Notebook, and a description of the purpose of each code fragment. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** \n",
    "\n",
    "Every unit of work should have its own function. A typical decomposition might be a function to read in the data, a function to process the data, and a function to print the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions need a comment describing the purpose, input, and return value. There are 2 ways to present this: \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Build a dictionary of all words. Takes a file as input, and returns a dictionary\n",
    "def build_dict(fin):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or the comments can come after the function declaration, as a Python docstring.  \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def build_dict(fin):\n",
    "    '''Build a dictionary of all words. Take a file as input, and return a dictionary'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops** \n",
    "\n",
    "Every loop needs a comment\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    # Read each word in the input file and insert it in the dictionary\n",
    "    for word in fin:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Comments** \n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that is not obvious should be commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example</u>: A useless comment\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    # add one to x\n",
    "    x = x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example</u>: A useful comment\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    # Make a list of pairs, ['abut', 'tuba'] if word is less than it's reverse\n",
    "    return [[word, word[::-1]] for word in lst if (word[::-1] >= word)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example</u>: A famous comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "/*\n",
    " * If the new process paused because it was\n",
    " * swapped out, set the stack level to the last call\n",
    " * to savu(u_ssav). This means that the return\n",
    " * which is executed immediately after the call to aretu\n",
    " * actually returns from the last routine which did\n",
    " * the savu.\n",
    " *\n",
    " * You are not expected to understand this.\n",
    " */\n",
    "if(rp->p_flag&SSWAP) {\n",
    "    rp->p_flag =& ~SSWAP;\n",
    "    aretu(u.u_ssav);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Names** \n",
    "\n",
    "Names are an important part of commenting. Names should be chosen with care, and should indicate the type of the variable. Consider the list comprehension above. Let's look at some other choices for the name of the key variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example</u>: Poor choice: We use i for integers, not for words. \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "return [[i, i[::-1]] for i in lst if (i[::-1] >= i)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example</u>: Better - but still much harder to read than the original. \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "return [[w, w[::-1]] for w in lst if (w[::-1] >= w)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid name clashes with standard Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they are not reserved words, do not name a variable str, list, dict, int, float, or the like. Python won't complain, but it will start to act funny and it will take you hours to find out why. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Page width**\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit your program to 80 columns. This is about the width of a page - the exact width depends upon the font choice, but 80 columns is a good rule of thumb. If you need more than 80 columns, read the next rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Less is More**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you need all those words? Hemingway didn't. And use whitespace to help your reader see the patterns and flow in your code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Make reading your code a pleasure, not a chore. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example below has many problems: we will only fix the comments and the lack of a return value. Though the code is (almost) identical, I claim the second is easier to read and comprehend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before editing:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# get two words and verify if they are anagrams with boolean values\n",
    "def are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n",
    "     # convert the first word to lowercase and use the all_perms() method to generate all permutations\n",

    "     else:\n",
    "          print(\"False\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After editing: \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Are word1 and word2 anagrams?\n",
    "# Takes two strings, and returns a boolean\n",

    "\n",

    "     return len(words) > 0 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parker's Precept: Don't print from a function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original version above prints the result. This is almost always a bad idea and leads to poor program design. When you call the `len()` function on a string, you don't want `len()` to print something: you want it to return the length. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't print, with the following exceptions:\n",
    "1. Printing during debugging \n",
    "2. Printing in a function with 'print' in the name, such as `print_results()` or `print_data()`\n",
